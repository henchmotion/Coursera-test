    <h1>Unified standard</h1>
<p> Just as the quality control department of a production company is responsible for maintaining a particular standard of a product. We also ensure that the standard of the worship ministry of Kingdom Diplomats would be same everywhere; where the level of expectations for everyone who walks into church in any of the chapters would be met.
Below are the standard rules we would look out for in the worship ministry of Kingdom Diplomats.
<ul>
    <li>Every music minister must be born again</li>
    <li>The music minister must be filled with Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues</li>
    <li>Every music minister must be engrafted into the mandate of the ministry by listening to the messages of the pastor daily.</li>
    <li>Go through the ministry schools</li>
    <li>There should be moderation in the dressing of every minister</li>
    <li>Every minster must get acquainted with songs of the ministry</li>
    <li>Every minister must give himself continually to the ministry of the word, prayer, fasting, soul winning and sacrifices to ensure fire on the altar.</li>
</ul>
