            <p id="p1">Introduction: The music ministry of Kingdom Diplomats began the same year the ministry began and has had successions of music directors embedded with so much of Godâ€™s Grace. And from then up till now God has journeyed us drawing men and women into the ministry who has helped enrich the worship ministry
                Though we began very little but never despised the days of our little beginning and having pressed on, God indeed increased our capacity of which is now multiplied in various chapters.
                </p>
            <p id="p2">Unified standard: Just as the quality control department of a production company is responsible for maintaining a particular standard of a product. We also ensure that the standard of the worship ministry of Kingdom Diplomats would be same everywhere; where the level of expectations for everyone who walks into church in any of the chapters would be met.
                Below are the standard rules we would look out for in the worship ministry of Kingdom Diplomats.
